Note that we could also decide the contrary: list polyfill-php71 so that any third party dep requiring it would not trigger the installation of the dep.
WDYT is best?

I like the second option: explicitly list the polyfill we won't need anyway.

Fine to me. According to this policy, I now rebased this PR on 3.3, and listed polyfill-iconv.
Then we should add polyfill-php71 when merging in 4.0.

And I unlisted `polyfill-apcu` because of the polyfill around `Zend Data Cache`.
